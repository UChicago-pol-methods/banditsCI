# Checks for Thompson Experiment


##### Code to see if batches are of correct sizes

# Validation: Probabilities will be the same from each batch start to end value, but probabilities will different at each respective batch start.

batch_splits <- sort(c(cumsum(batch_sizes), c(1, cumsum(batch_sizes) +1) )) # New variable that includes the start and end indexes for batches
batch_splits <- batch_splits[batch_splits != max(batch_splits)] # Removal max

batch_size_check <- results$probs[batch_splits,300,] # Choose correct subset
batch_size_check <- as.data.frame(batch_size_check) #make the indexed data a data frame

batch_size_column <- paste0("Batch ", rep(1:(length(batch_splits)/2), each = 2) , c(' Start ', ' End '), '(', batch_splits, ')' )
batch_size_check <- cbind(Batches = batch_size_column, batch_size_check)

bsc_column_Names <- c("Batches (Time Value)", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2", "Treatment 3", "Treatment 4")
colnames(batch_size_check) <- bsc_column_Names

batch_size_check

# To view dataframe
View(batch_size_check)



##### In the first batch, are all assignment probabilities uniform? Is this the case across all contexts?

# Validation: All probabilities for time 100 for all contexts (A = 500) for all treatments (K = 4) that equal 1/data[[1]]$K will be equivalent to 100 * data[[1]]$A * data[[1]]$K

# This code indexes the first batch of results$probs and makes sure that all values are equal to 0.25
sum(results$probs[1:batch_sizes[1],,] == 1/data[[1]]$K) # 1/data[[1]]$K is 1/4 = 0.25



##### Conditional on a context and time period do assignment probabilities always sum to one

# Validation: For every value of time (data[[1]]$A = 500) a value of data[[1]]$A * data[[1]]$K (context * Treatment) will be output

sums_to_one <- rep(NA, data[[1]]$A) # Create empty vector with as many elements as observations in the experiment

# Loop over each time period
for(i in 1:data[[1]]$A){
  # Save the summed probabilities across treatments for each context conditional
  # On time
  sums_to_one[i] <- table(rowSums(results$probs[i,,])) # Iterate data and make a table to correct rounding
}
sums_to_one



##### Are probability floors being correctly implemented? Check that there is no probability below the assigned floor.
##### Does the smallest probability assigned get smaller over time?

# Validation: floor_check will output FALSE for every time (data[[1]]$A) across context (data[[1]]$A) and treatment (data[[1]]$K)

# For loop iterates each time and makes sure no treatment assignment probabilities are below probability floor
floor_check <- rep(NA, data[[1]]$A) #what to input in this first slot

probability_floor <- (floor_start / (floor_decay * i)) # Probability floor equation

# Iterate results$probs to check for values less than calculated probability floors
for (i in 1:data[[1]]$A){

  floor_check[i] <- any(results$probs[i, ,] < probability_floor)
}
floor_check

# Identify where probability floor is not being correctly implemented
which(floor_check)

# How many values where floor check is not being correctly implemented
sum(which(floor_check))



##### From our data, we should know which treatment arm is best for every context.
##### Plot the probability that an observation is assigned its true best treatment over time. Is this decreasing?
##### Do this separately for each context group, i.e., among observations that arm 1 is best for, among observations that arm 2 is best for, etc.

# Validation: Check that for each "ws <- results$ws[which(data$data$muxs[,1:K]==1)]" the best treatment is assigned to the most subjects
