Description: Provides functions for conducting bandit-based experiments, evaluating policies, and applying adaptive weighting schemes. Useful for researchers and practitioners working on reinforcement learning and experimental design. The methods implemented in this package are based on Zhan et al. (2021) <arXiv:2106.02029> and Hadad et al. (2021) <arXiv:1911.02768>. The code in this package is adapted from the original Python code available at <https://github.com/gsbDBI/adaptive-confidence-intervals> and <https://github.com/gsbDBI/contextual_bandits_evaluation>.
