Description: Provides functions for conducting frequentist inference on adaptively generated data. The methods implemented are based on Zhan et al. (2021) <arXiv:2106.02029> and Hadad et al. (2021) <arXiv:1911.02768>. For illustration, several functions for simulating non-contextual and contextual adaptive experiments using Thompson sampling are also supplied.
