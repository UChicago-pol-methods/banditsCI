\title{calculate_mu_hat Function}
\usage{
calculate_mu_hat(results)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{a list containing the results of a bandit model, including the fitted model and the covariate matrix xs}
}
\value{
A vector containing the estimated expected value of the reward for each arm
}
\description{
The calculate_mu_hat function calculates the estimated expected value of the reward for each arm, given the results of a bandit model.
}
